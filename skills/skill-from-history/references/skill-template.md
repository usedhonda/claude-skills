Claude: Generating firebase-auth-flow skill...

Created:
- .claude/skills/firebase-auth-flow/SKILL.md (1,847 words)
- .claude/skills/firebase-auth-flow/references/patterns.md
- .claude/commands/firebase-auth-flow.md (Command: ✓ Recommend)

The skill includes:
- 8 evidence references (E1-E8)
- Evidence Index with sessions, commits, and code patterns
- 1 Critical constraint from negative learning

You can now use this skill by:
- Slash command: `/firebase-auth-flow`
- Natural language: "Firebase auth" or "authentication flow"
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Skills Focused

Each skill should address one coherent domain:
- Good: `firebase-auth-flow` (single domain)
- Bad: `firebase-and-api-and-deploy` (too broad)

### Evidence Quality

Prioritize evidence that shows:
1. **Explicit patterns**: Clear code examples
2. **User corrections**: Anti-patterns to avoid
3. **Recent commits**: Current best practices

### Progressive Disclosure

Generated skills should also use progressive disclosure:
- Main SKILL.md: Overview and essential patterns
- references/: Detailed examples, edge cases, troubleshooting

## Command Template (Optional)

For skills with Command recommendation (✓ Recommend), also generate a command file:

**Location**: `.claude/commands/[skill-name].md`

**Format**:
```markdown
---
description: [Brief description from skill]
---

# [Skill Title]

[When to Use summary from SKILL.md]

This command invokes the [skill-name] skill.

Usage:
- `/[skill-name]` - [Primary use case]
```

**Example**: `.claude/commands/multi-ai-review.md`
```markdown
---
description: Review with ChatGPT and Gemini for comprehensive feedback
---

# Multi-AI Review

Invoke this command when completing significant features or making architectural decisions.

This command triggers the multi-ai-review workflow:
1. Prepare review context
2. Ask ChatGPT for feedback
3. Ask Gemini for second opinion
4. Compare and extract common concerns

Usage:
- `/multi-ai-review` - Start multi-AI review workflow
```
